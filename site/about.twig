<p>Hi, my name is Arkadiusz Kondas and I am a Data Scientist and Software Architect from Poland.
	My main skills revolve around PHP and Machine Learning.</p>

<p>I am a open-source evangelist, an passionate programmer,	a pragmatist and a good teacher.</p>

<p>I have been professionally involved in programming since 2008.</p>

<p>I led and created teams developing advanced information systems. I created, planned and developed high and low level architecture.<p>

<p>I change and develop enterprises using Event Storming.</p>

<p>I am currently working for <a href="https://buddy.works" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">Buddy</a>, creating the best tools supporting the daily work of developers (CI/CD server).</p>

<p>In my free time I run in mountain ultramarathons.</p>

<p>I want to create software that allows you to change the world.</p>

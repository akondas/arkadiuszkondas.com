title: Predict air pollution with k-Nearest Neighbors and PHP
description: "Based on air pollution data we will try to predict air quality in a place where we do not have data. I will present k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and how to implement such prediction in PHP using php-ml."

Disclaimer: In this post we will not predict the future only the current state at place where we do not have data. 
We will try predict the future in other posts, so subscribe to my newsletter to not leave the topic.
